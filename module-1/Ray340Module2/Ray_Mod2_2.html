        <h2>Starting From Scratch</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Brittni Ray and I am from Seattle, Washington. Although I am originally from Seattle, I currently live in Orlando, Fl. I currently work for Walt Disney World as a Character Performer.</p>
        <p>I have many, many hobbies, just like a character I love and adore, Rapunzel! <span class="sentence">I enjoy painting and am currently painting my dresser to look similar to Feyre's dresser from the ACOTAR series.</span> I also really enjoy singing, but cannot do it so much nowadays because I use my voice so much for work.</p>
        <p>A while ago, I lived in Japan on two separate occasions--both times in Tokyo, but once in Mitaka, Tokyo and another time in Nakano, Tokyo. The first time I lived in Japan, I was a student at International Christian University in Mitaka, Tokyo. The second time, I was a Prefectural Advisor for the JET program in Shinjuku, Tokyo.</p>
        <p>I am currently in Orlando, Florida working full time for Walt Disney World at my dream job! I meet a lot of people everyday and enjoy getting to share in the magic. What I do is very special and I am lucky to be here, even if balancing school and work is sometimes overwhelming!</p>
